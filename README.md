# Decentralized Education Platform

A blockchain-based platform for decentralized education and certification, enabling transparent, verifiable, and peer-reviewed learning experiences.

## Overview

The Decentralized Education Platform revolutionizes traditional online learning by leveraging blockchain technology to create a trustless, transparent, and decentralized educational ecosystem. The platform enables:

- Secure and verifiable course completion certificates as NFTs
- Transparent peer review and grading systems
- Direct payment channels between students and instructors
- Immutable course content and student progress tracking

## Architecture

The platform consists of four main smart contracts:

### Course Contract
- Course content management and versioning
- Student enrollment and progress tracking
- Assignment submission and completion verification
- Integration with IPFS for content storage
- Prerequisite management and course sequencing

### Certification Contract
- ERC-721 compliant NFT certificates
- Metadata storage for achievement details
- Certificate verification system
- Achievement badges and micro-credentials
- Historical record of earned certifications

### Payment Contract
- Course fee processing
- Instructor payment distribution
- Refund management
- Token-based incentive systems
- Multi-currency support

### Peer Review Contract
- Assignment distribution to reviewers
- Review quality assessment
- Reviewer reputation system
- Dispute resolution mechanism
- Incentive structure for quality reviews

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Hardhat
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet
- IPFS node (optional for content hosting)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decentralized-education-platform

# Install dependencies
cd decentralized-education-platform
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

### Smart Contract Deployment
```bash
# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests
npx hardhat test

# Deploy to testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network testnet
```

## Usage

### For Students
1. Connect wallet and browse available courses
2. Enroll in courses by paying the required fee
3. Submit assignments and participate in peer reviews
4. Earn NFT certificates upon course completion

### For Instructors
1. Create and publish courses
2. Set course fees and enrollment requirements
3. Review student submissions
4. Receive payments automatically through smart contracts

### For Reviewers
1. Sign up as a peer reviewer
2. Review assigned submissions
3. Earn reputation and rewards for quality reviews
4. Participate in dispute resolution

## Security Considerations

- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations
- Time-locked operations for certificate issuance
- Rate limiting for peer reviews
- Slashing conditions for malicious behavior
- Regular security audits
